# DarkCometV2
A hodge-podge Volatility script to dump Dark Comet Config from both 32 and 64 bit memory captures

It is mostly based of dfirn00b's script (https://github.com/dfirn00b/volatility_plugins) with some changes so it will work on 64 bit captures. It is not as clean-- but it works in a pinch :)
